A simple but pleasantly looking landing page for a gift shop.

It's a project made to give a demo of my skill set.

The page is fully responsive.

Key applied skills: HTML, CSS(SCSS, media queries), JS(DOM, event listeners), BEM, responsive images, complete set of fonts for different browsers, Git/Git flow.
